### 58. Local Scope and Functions
***Task-58 The editor has two console.logs to help you see what is happening. Check the console as you code to see how it changes. Declare a local variable myVar inside myLocalScope and run the tests.***
```js
function myLocalScope() {

var myVar = "john"

console.log('inside myLocalScope', myVar);
}
myLocalScope();

console.log('outside myLocalScope', myVar);
